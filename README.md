# MusicPlayerGUI

**SECOND TIME THAT I AM WRITING THIS README.md BTW, LESSON LEARNED: **DO NOT FORCE PUSH** ;(

This project is a music player with a GUI made in Java. It has most of the modern media player functions that you are used to today: play, pause, fast forward, rewind, skip, previous,
autoplay, loop, and queue (still working on this one, having a bit of trouble). 

To use the program, the user can upload a song file by clicking on the upload button. The user can also delete a song from the song list that is displayed in the song box in the center.
Some other features include: 


auto-updating file management system (program checks for existing saved song files (user does not have to reupload previously uploaded songs), program maintains list of files and how to access them, updates the list if the user deletes the song)


auto-updating current song playing label


auto-updating song list (if a song is deleted, the song will be removed from the list)


multiple preventative tests (error messages will be displayed for approriate "user error" actions and will not crash the program),
